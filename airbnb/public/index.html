      manifest.json provides metadata used when your web app is installed on a

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

              Created React components and used events in application to add dynamic functionality to app.
              Organized code at the component level, proper usage of state and props are demonstrated throughout the project, the UI is composed of small reusable components, proper usage of useState and useEffect hooks are clearly incorperated and correctly implemented.
              Implemented Read operations using either Axios or Fetch to display 3rd party data on page. Route management properly installed and used to show top level pages as well as nested views where necessary. Data displayed on page is properly laid out in a modern easy to interperate fashion. Seemless integration of UI static landing page now incorporated.
